The characteristics listed should be representative of the role but do not need to be exhaustive; particularly as team members becomes more senior, underlying experience can become assumed. The tone of each characteristic should reflect an individual who has obtained the proficiency expected that corresponds to the position. When combined together the characteristics should be **inspirational** as it is unlikely that a team member has achieved the desired proficiency in all characteristics.

## Guiding Concepts

The characteristics listed against the role should speak to the following concepts:

- Craft
  
  The technical skills and domain knowledge expected of the role.

- Delivery

  How tasks are prioritised, setting realistic goals and predicting bottlenecks.

- Culture

  How we collaborate and communicate both within a team and cross-teams. This also relates to how an individual contributes to broader community.

- Leadership

  This applies at all levels of the career ladder. It may take the form of taking the initiative to find mentors, being a mentor, taking ownership of work done, studying best practices or showing autonomy and personal growth. At higher levels, it involves helping to improve and measure the effectiveness of the team.

- Impact

  The business acumen and strategic thinking that helps us move beyond where we are and then on towards or even beyond "best". It involves understanding more that the basic utility of the procedures and processes we use or we offer our customers.

- Growth

  Everyone should be encouraged to pursue personal and professional growth.

## Language

Each characteristic should be written from the point of view of the person it relates to. Commonly that means the sentence will start with `I`.

In some cases, as roles progress in seniority, the same statement may apply but the language evolves:

- I am learning
- I am becoming proficient
- I am proficient

Other sentiments that may apply are:

- I am aware
- I am comfortable
- I understand
- I can confidently
- I recognise
- I am actively
- I proactively
- I invest in
