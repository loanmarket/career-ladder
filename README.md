# Loan Market Group Technology Ladder

This repository describes the technical roles within the group.

It seeks to describe some **defining characteristics** about each role, and provide some concrete **examples** along the way.

It's the anchor point used through all of our feedback and promotion cycles.

This is a living set of documents, maintained by the very people it affects.

## Guiding Concepts

- Craft
  
  The technical skills and domain knowledge expected of the role.

- Delivery

  How tasks are prioritised, setting realistic goals and predicting bottlenecks.

- Culture

  How we collaborate and communicate both within a team and cross-teams. This also relates to how an individual contributes to broader community.

- Leadership

  This applies at all levels of the career ladder. It may take the form of taking the initiative to find mentors, being a mentor, taking ownership of work done, studying best practices or showing autonomy and personal growth. At higher levels, it involves helping to improve and measure the effectiveness of the steam.

- Impact

  The business acumen and strategic thinking that helps us move beyond where we are and then on towards or even beyond "best". It involves understanding more that the basic utility of the procedures and processes we use or we offer our customers.
