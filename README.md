# Loan Market Group Technology Ladder

This repository describes the technical roles within the group.

It seeks to describe some **defining characteristics** about each role, and provide some concrete **examples** along the way. Each example should be both **attainable** and **reasonable** to expect of a team member in that role, but overall the collection should be treated as **aspirational**. It is most important that an individual exhibits the broad **attitude** and **behaviour** described.

It's the anchor point used through all of our feedback and promotion cycles. This is a living set of documents, maintained by the very people it affects.
